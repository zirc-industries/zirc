# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Last updated: 2025-08-28

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement" or "CLA") is a legal document between you ("You" or "Contributor") and the project maintainers ("Project", "We", "Us"). By contributing code, documentation, tests, examples, bug reports, patches, or other materials ("Contribution(s)") to this repository, you agree to the terms set forth below.

This CLA explains the rights you grant to the Project, the warranties and representations you make, and the expectations for contribution provenance and review. The goal is to protect contributors and users by keeping the project's intellectual property and licensing clear and unambiguous.

## 1. Definitions

- "Project" refers to the repository and any subprojects, modules, or packages explicitly under this repository's ownership.
- "Maintainers" means the people or organization designated to manage and accept Contributions into the Project.
- "Contribution(s)" means any original or third-party code, patches, documentation, tests, examples, or other materials you submit to the Project by pull request, issue, patch file, email, or other mechanism.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable license to:

- reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works in source and binary forms under the Project's license; and
- include your Contributions in a larger work that the Project distributes under the Project's license or compatible licenses.

This license applies to the Contribution as a whole, but does not affect any license rights you may have previously granted for your Contribution.

## 3. Patent License

If you own or control patent rights that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution, you hereby grant the Project and recipients of the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and derivative works thereof under such patent rights, to the extent necessary to exercise the rights granted under Section 2. This patent license is conditioned on the same rights being available to all downstream recipients under the Project license.

## 4. Moral Rights / Attribution

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any moral rights or attribution requirements over your Contributions as necessary for the Project to use, modify, and distribute your Contributions under the Project license. You agree to provide reasonable attribution in Project materials when appropriate, and you acknowledge that inclusion of your name in a contributors list is standard but not required.

## 5. Representations and Warranties

By making a Contribution, you represent and warrant that:

- You have the legal right and authority to make this Agreement and to grant the rights described herein.
- Your Contribution is your original work, or you have sufficient rights from the copyright owner to submit the work under this Agreement.
- Your Contribution does not violate the intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other legal rights of any third party.
- Your Contribution does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or code intended to compromise user security or privacy.

You agree to indemnify the Project and its users against claims arising from breach of the above representations.

## 6. Third-Party Code and Licensing

If your Contribution includes third-party code or materials not authored by you:

- You must ensure that such third-party materials are licensed in a way that is compatible with the Project license and that you have the right to relicense them under the Project license.
- You must clearly document the provenance and license of any third-party material included in your Contribution (for example, in a header comment or in an accompanying NOTICE or DEPENDENCIES file).
- Contributions that rely on proprietary or incompatible-licensed components will not be accepted.

## 7. Corporate Contributors

If you are contributing on behalf of an employer, client, or other third party:

- Confirm that you are authorized to make contributions and accept this CLA on behalf of that entity.
- You may be required to provide a corporate signature or confirmation from an authorized representative if requested by the Project maintainers.

## 8. How to Sign / Accept the CLA

There are multiple accepted ways to indicate agreement with this CLA. Choose one of the following when making a Contribution:

- Electronic Agreement: Include the following signed statement in the body of your pull request or issue description:

  "I hereby agree to the terms of the Project Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in CLA.md."

- Commit Sign-off: Add a sign-off line to your commit message as described by the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO):

  "Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>"

  This is acceptable only if you are the sole author of the Contribution and you have the right to grant the rights above.

- Corporate Confirmation: For corporate contributors, include a note from an authorized representative on company letterhead or email verifying that the contributor is authorized to sign on behalf of the organization.

Maintainers may require additional confirmation for large or sensitive Contributions.

## 9. Acceptance Process

- Maintainers review Contributions for quality, compatibility, and alignment with the Project's goals.
- Acceptance of a Contribution is at the discretion of the maintainers.
- When a Contribution is accepted, the maintainers will merge the Contribution or otherwise incorporate it into the Project. Acceptance implies the maintainers' understanding that the Contribution is licensed under the Project license and this CLA.

## 10. License Compatibility and Re-licensing

- This CLA is intended to work with the Project's existing license. Contributors should ensure their Contributions can be distributed under the Project license.
- The Project may re-license the code in the future; by contributing, you agree that maintainers may re-license your Contributions (or include them in versions licensed differently) provided the Project gives reasonable notice in the repository and the new license is compatible with the Project's stated goals. If you cannot accept re-licensing, you must notify maintainers before contributing.

## 11. Withdrawal of a Contribution

- You may request removal of your Contribution from the Project's repository; maintainers will consider such requests in good faith.
- However, once Contributions are merged and distributed (including in source control history, releases, or forks), removal may not be fully possible.
- The rights you granted in Section 2 are irrevocable as to existing distributions; withdrawal only affects future, not past, distribution.

## 12. Exceptions and Special Cases

- If a Contribution cannot reasonably be covered by this CLA (for example, third-party code with a particular license requirement), disclose the issue in the PR and work with the maintainers to resolve licensing details prior to acceptance.
- Maintainers may request additional paperwork for corporate contributions, or refuse Contributions that present licensing or legal concerns.

## 13. Enforcement and Changes

- The Project maintains the right to enforce this CLA and revoke or refuse Contributions that materially violate this Agreement.
- The Project may update this CLA as needed. Changes will be documented with dates and a summary. Previously accepted Contributions remain governed by the terms under which they were accepted unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## 14. No Warranty

- Contributions are provided to the Project without warranty of any kind. The Project and its maintainers assume no liability for Contributions beyond what is required by law.

## 15. Contact and Questions

If you have questions about this CLA, or need to provide corporate authorization or other documentation, contact the maintainers via the repository's issue tracker or the project contact listed in [README.md](README.md).
